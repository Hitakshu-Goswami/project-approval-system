git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).

## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase (Backend & Authentication)
- Google Gemini AI (for project evaluation)

## Setting up AI Evaluation

The project includes an AI-powered evaluation system that uses Google's Gemini API. The system works with a fallback mechanism:

### Basic Evaluation (Default)
The application includes a built-in evaluation system that works immediately without any setup. It evaluates projects based on:
- Title clarity and length
- Description detail and completeness
- Presence of clear goals and objectives
- Overall project structure

### Full AI Evaluation (Optional)
For enhanced AI evaluation using Google Gemini:

1. Get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable in your Supabase project
3. The system will automatically use AI evaluation when the key is available

**Note**: The application works perfectly without the Gemini API key - it will use the built-in evaluation system as a fallback.
